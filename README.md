# CASIA-CXR: An Open Chest X-ray Dataset with Benchmarks for Automatic Radiology Report Generation in French

# Introduction
Automatic radiology report generation is a cross-domain task that aims to produce long, clinically accurate, and semantically coherent reports describing medical images (e.g., a chest X-ray). Through the success of image captioning, medical report generation has been achievable. However, generating language-specific radiology reports presents a challenging task for data-driven models, which rely heavily on paired image-report datasets that are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. In this paper, we introduce a new chest X-ray benchmark dataset, namely CASIA-CXR, consisting of high-resolution chest radiographs associated with medical reports originally written in French. The dataset includes patient examinations conducted between 2019 and 2022, performed and reported by radiologists across various hospitals in France. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public chest radiograph dataset with medical reports in this particular language. Importantly, we propose an effective encoder-decoder framework for medical report generation in French validated using our proposed dataset. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method using metrics from natural language generation and clinical efficacy in addition to the human evaluation performed by radiologists. The results are promising as reported. The dataset is freely available to advance a wide range of research in medical computer vision and natural language processing.
