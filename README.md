# CASIA-CXR: An Open Dataset of Chest X-rays with Benchmarks on Automatic Radiology Report Generation

# Abstract
Automated medical report generation is a challenging cross-domain task that aims to produce long, semantically coherent, and clinically accurate reports describing medical images (e.g., a chest X-ray). Machine learning techniques have thus arisen to alleviate the burden and potentially expedite clinical workflows. However, data availability is essential for applying these techniques in the clinical setting. Compared to well-known image captioning tasks, medical report generation is more challenging for data-driven neural models, which rely heavily on paired image-report datasets that are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. To address this gap, we present a new dataset of chest radiographs, namely CASIA-CXR, a high-resolution chest radiograph containing 5,544 images of patients examined and reported between 2019 and 2022 by radiologists in different hospitals in France, in conjunction with free-text reports originally written in French. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public dataset of chest radiographs with medical reports in this language. Importantly, we propose an you can add some important two sentences here and reliable medical report generation benchmark validated using our proposed dataset. Although, the results are promising as reported. In addition to widely used NLG metrics, human evaluation performed by professional radiologists shows that our model significantly improves clinical efficacy and accuracy over various baselines. Due to privacy concerns, all images and reports were anonymized and de-identified. The dataset is freely available to support and advance a wide range of research in medical computer vision and natural language processing. The dataset can be downloaded from our website (www.casia-cxr.net).
