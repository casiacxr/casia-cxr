# CASIA-CXR: An Open Dataset of Chest X-rays with Benchmarks on Automatic Radiology Report Generation

# Abstract
Automated medical report generation is a challenging cross-domain task that aims to produce long, semantically coherent, and clinically accurate reports describing medical images (e.g., a chest X-ray). Machine learning techniques have thus arisen to alleviate the burden and potentially expedite clinical workflows. However, data availability is essential for applying these techniques in the clinical setting. Compared to well-known image captioning tasks, medical report generation is more challenging for data-driven neural models, which rely heavily on paired image-report datasets that are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. To address this gap, we present a new dataset of chest radiographs, namely CASIA-CXR, a high-resolution chest radiograph containing 5,544 images of patients examined and reported by radiologists between 2019 and 2022 in different hospitals in France, in conjunction with free-text reports originally written in French. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public dataset of chest radiographs with medical reports in this language. Importantly, we propose a simple yet efficient encoder-decoder framework to produce a reliable benchmark for medical report generation validated using our proposed dataset. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method using metrics from natural language generation and clinical efficacy in addition to the human evaluation performed by professional radiologists. The results are promising as reported.  Due to privacy concerns, all images and reports were anonymized and de-identified. The dataset is freely available to advance a wide range of research in medical computer vision and natural language processing. The dataset can be downloaded from our website (www.casia-cxr.net).
